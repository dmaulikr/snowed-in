We're Snowed In!
A Puzzle Game for iPhone and iPad by Matthew Webber

We're Snowed In! is a single-player puzzle game. The core game
mechanic is similar to Sokoban, with the addition of special tiles
that invert every square, turning walls to empty space and vice-versa.

IMPORTANT - Exclusions

At time of writing (June 2012) this project compiles and runs in my development
environment. HOWEVER, this git repo currently excludes:

* All financial transaction code, for security reasons.
* The cocos2d library, available at http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/
* The proprietary SquidMixer common library.

Without these, you will not be able to run this app in your simulator or on
your device. Sorry. This repo is intended to show what I've built and how I've
structured my code, not to distribute a fully-functional version of my app.
